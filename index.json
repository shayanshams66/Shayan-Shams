My extensive experience and in-depth background in deep learning and machine learning with expertise in unsupervised, semi-supervised and transfer learning has led to the development of AI models in various domains from Radiology, Pathology,Biology to Social Sciences. I am currently working on multidisciplinary projects as collaborating with various domain experts from Radiology, Pathology, Dentistry, and Neurology.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://shayanshams66.github.io/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"I am an assistant professor in the Center for Health Security and Phenotyping at the University of Texas Health at Houston.
